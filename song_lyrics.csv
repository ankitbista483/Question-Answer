- Wrong Ones (Feat. Tim McGraw),Post Malone,"24 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsPolskiEspañolWrong Ones Lyrics[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Lift kit on a limousine
I got ten problems down in Tennessee
And I ain't got the time to fix 'em all
Skipped breakfast at Tiffany's
For a little sermon with Bethany
Now I'm sittin' at a bar on 17th, and I'm gone

[Chorus: Post Malone]
With them cold ones comin'
And that smoke fillin' up my lungs
I got fuck-you money
Girl, come on and get you some
And it's hard to walk a straight line
When they curvin' up them jeans
I'm just lookin' for the right one
But them wrong ones keep lookin' at me

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
Straight outta Louisian'
I'm a bad boy, real good man
Got a six-pack and a farmer's tan, top of the world (Ooh)
I can't help that they wanna glance
Ain't one that don't wanna dance
Bunch of cowboys sayin', ""Please don't take thе girl""

But them wrong ones keep lookin' at me

Catfish caviar, south of Florida, cigar

And George Jones crankin' out my Coupe DeVille
Yeah, I'm a five-star
Hell-raisin' dive-bar rockstar

I got a thang for the finer things
I'm in that deer blind with a diamond ring
My Lambo and my ammo's all camo-green
Yeah, I got a F-1 Trillion limousine
I got a ten-point blonde in the shotgun seat
I got a thang, got a thang for the finer things
Yeah, I do (Ooh, hm)

[Verse 2: Hank Williams Jr.]
I got a fifty-foot pontoon, tripled-up Evinrude
Leavin' me a tidal wave of wake when I flow through
Sippin' on a Solo of Pappy Reserve
Big H on the top for my getaway bird
Aw, turn up the ""Rambling Man""
'Til the whole lake knows I'm a Hank fan

You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?

Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with a view

It goes without sayin', she put me in the past
And that train left the station, she didn't have to tell me why
There she goes without sayin', without sayin' goodbye
Goes without sayin' (Goes without sayin')
Without sayin' goodbye"

I got a guy to sight in my rifle
My mama's new boyfriend re-binds bibles
Ricky down the road, he resoles Red Wings
Hell, I got a guy for every damn thing
Oh, that ain't exactly what I'm lookin' for
'Cause I'm lookin' for

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Someone to put her tires back in the drive
And if they don't, then I just might
Lose what's left of my never-lovin' mind
I'm damn near down to my last dime
I'm pretty good at breakin' down a heart
But pickin' up the pieces is the hard part
She's searchin' for someone who's gonna build it back
But I ain't got a guy for that

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Ain't got a guy for that, ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy for that

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]

And he still won't let mе fly the time machine
Somеone to turn back the hands on my new AP

[Verso 1: Post Malone]
Encontré a Dios buscando al diablo
Persiguiendo una altura que no podría mantener para siempre
Siempre es peor antes de lo mejor, supongo
Y qué tan abajo , es difícil saber
Cuándo comprar y cuándo vender
Porque esa caída duele muchísimo
Y cada espina tiene su rosa

[Estribillo: Post Malone]
A veces conduces, a veces te detienes
A veces vuelas, a veces caes
Pero todavía hay bellеza en la caída en picada
A vecеs corres, a veces te arrastras
A veces estás arruinado, a veces estás bailando
Pero todavía hay belleza en la caída en picada

[Verso 2: Lainey Wilson]
Golpeé una roca y dejé caer la pala
Me abrí paso entre los escombros
Haz lo mejor que puedo, no te metas en problemas, Dios lo sabe
A veces, la imagen no es perfecta
Pero se aprende en el dolor '
Harto de soportar toda la carga
Cada espina tiene su rosa

Pareja Chucks, Ern's y Chandler's
Con un montón de oraciones sin respuesta
Whisky al mediodía y cerveza antes
Tren en dirección sur en una vía infernal
Podría simplemente levantar dos dedos medios y tirar uno hacia atrás
Para todas las personas que nunca se han sentido como en casa
Sólo girando sobre una roca y drogándose

Los marginados y los pecadores

Would you pack a never-comin'-back-again bag?
If the three-times-four's bangin' at our door
Would you stall and let me slip out the back?
Girl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to
That never-endin' honeymoon Mexico sun?
'Cause you know I adore ya
No shit, I'd kill a man for ya
And if I did, would you hide my gun?

I swear I saw a message in them white and yellow lines
And I ain’t sayin' I'm a killer or if I'll ever be

Would you still love me if we were down bad and out a home?
I made all my money singin' so sad and lonely songs
But all my diamonds came from dirt
The more I love you, the less I hurt
And now my pen can't find the words

I wrote songs about sinnin', evil women, pills, and cars
I wrote songs about drinkin' 'til you walked in and raised the bar
But who am I to write rock-bottom from the highs you took me to?
Thank God I was right about you

[Verse 2]
You can say you hate me as long as you don't mean it
Maybe go half crazy, don't need a rhyme or reason
Girl, you can go and pick a fight, slam that door and lock me outside
Just for one night so I can find a brand-new melody

I was hangin' 'round in Brooklyn town with a settle-down-type girl
Her daddy was a diplomat who thought he ruled the world
And he was well-connected, he helped me connect the dots
He paid me off to leave, and let's just say he paid a lot

[Chorus: Post Malone & Billy Strings]
I guess it's M-E-X-I-C-O for me
Laid up in the shade of a coconut tree
And love said, ""Go to Hell,"" but there's somewhere I'd rather be
So it's M-E-X-I-C-O for me

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
So I took her daddy's money, but I stopped in Vegas first
I met a dancer on the strip and fell in love with her
We almost tied the knot when Elvis asked, ""Any objections?""
Her mobster boyfriend busted in with an AK-47

[Chorus: Post Malone & Billy Strings]
Guess it's M-E-X-I-C-O for me
Laid up in the shade of a coconut tree
And love said, ""Go to Hell,"" but there's somewhere I'd rather be

On a stool in the corner, where he's been all week
Only way I know he's breathin' is he just took a drink

And he keeps headin' toward the neon light

There's a hole in his heart down at the hole in the wall
They found him with his hand wrapped 'round a whiskey poured too strong
There ain't no murder weapon, just a note that says she's gone
And if they put it in the paper, then it wouldn't say much at all
One man dead at the honky tonk

[Verse 2]
We all saw it comin' from a mile away
We knew that her goodbye would put him in the grave
And, no, she won't go to prison, but he's doin' life
She tied him to the bar and let that firewater rise

Threw my bottle at the sky, said, ""God, that's a warning""

The way I gotta flex, you'd think I did Pilates

After thirty High Noons, it was pretty cool
Tried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shoot

I guess I shoulda kept that shit to myself
Turns out I'm pretty good at running my mouth
But not good enough
You know when I go in it's lights out
I couldn't hear a thing 'cause the song was too loud
Last night I had 32 teeth in my mouth
Some went away...
Why'd you have to go and fucking ruin my day?
You're the reason why I got my ass kicked
But you're the only way to drown my sadness
This is my love/hate letter out to alcohol
You're the reason why I got my ass kicked
I was laid out flat like a centerfold
Jakey and his partner drove me home
Looking in the mirror something's wrong
Let me get my dentist on the phone
Found my keys then I went back out
Someone asked me how it all went down
I remember like it's yesterday
I took a shot, took a shot, took a shot, took another shot
Fell right out my fucking chair swinging for his eye
Then a big chrome ring flew in from the side
I thought I died...
Why'd you have to go and fucking ruin my night?

Got no expectations now that I'm forsaken
Let's see what I'm made of, find out if I can take it, now

Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up, feels like a punch in the gut

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

[Verse 2]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home

Kiedyś miałem przyjaciół teraz mam wrogów (Ooh)
Kiedyś trzymałem ich blisko teraz są dla mnie martwi (Kuźwa)
Kiedyś miałem przyjaciół teraz mam wrogów (Ooh)
Wrogów, ta, to takie smutne

[Zwrotka 1: Post Malone]
Mówili, że nigdy nie zajdę tak daleko, ach, ach
Myślisz, że nie widzimy kim jesteś, jesteś, jesteś?
Śmieję się do banku tak ha, ha, ha
Myślę, że po prostu mówię za dużo bla, bla, bla (Zamknij się, do chuja)
To gdzieście poszli?
Kiedy byłem spłukany, nie mogłem nawet kupić fajek
Teraz twoja mamuśka potrzebuje biletów na mój koncert na stadionie (Koncert na stadionie)
Ona to kocha kiedy słyszy mnie w radiu
Wiem, że ciężko przełknąć swoją dumę
Przepraszam, że nie możecie o mnie zapomnieć (O mnie)
Nie jesteście już w moim życiu, czuję taką ulgę, ja

[Refren: Post Malone]
Kiedyś miałem przyjaciół teraz mam wrogów (Kuźwa)
Kiedyś trzymałem ich blisko teraz są dla mnie martwi (Ooh)
Pieniądz zwykle pokazuje ich wszystkie skłonności (Kuźwa)
Wrogów, ta, to takie smutne

[Zwrotka 2: DaBaby]
Blisko moich wrogów (Lecimy)
Potrzebuję lepszej energii (Huh?)
Kiedy powiedziałem Ci pierdol się, myślałeś, że się zgrywam, huh?
(Tak, tak) ale mówiłem to kurwa na serio
Ona chciała żeby coś zaiskrzyło ale ja powiedziałem jej jebać to (Nie)
Patrzy na mnie, jakby zdziwiona
Pakują Post'a i jestem sam w domu
Kiedy karton uderza w drzwi, idą na 35
Próbuje być najlepszy dla moich partnerek, zmieniają się w moich wrogów na moich oczach
Podajesz mi rękę, ja wystawię pięść
Dajesz mi funciaka bez frytek
Właśnie zdobyłem dwa razy platynę bez udziału innych osób
Tylko by mu pokazać, że tak naprawdę go nie potrzebuję
Dajcie człowiekowi talerz, on może zrobić, że się zatrzęsie
To pewnik, że zagnie i ugryzie rękę która go karmi
I wiem, że myślisz, że tego nie widzę
I wiem dziwko, że nie masz auta
Nie zmuszaj mnie, żebym poszedł i kupił dziwce Priuska
Ruchanie na kamerze i jesteśmy kwita
Przyjaciele są jak jesień, każdego roku odchodzą
Zagrabię ich na kupkę i wrzucę do wora
Zwiążę dziwki i ich zostawię
Bo większość tych kurw jest złudna
A ja (Ooh)

It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away"

Ah evet,ah evet,ah evet
Evet,benim için ölürdün
Benim için ölebileceğini söyledin,benim için ölebileceğini söyledin
Ama yalan söyledin,bana yalan söyledin

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Benim için kurşunun önüne atlayabileceğini,benim için ölebileceğini söyledin
Bana yalan söylediğin hissine kapılıyorum
Düşüşlerdeydik, ama benimle yükseliyordun
11'i geçtiğinde, gördüğüm başka bir tarafındı
Benim için ölebileceğini söyledin,benim için ölebileceğini söyledin
Ama bana yalan söyledin,bana yalan söyledin
Benim için ölebileceğini söyledin,benim için ölebileceğini söyledin
Ama bana yalan söyledin,bana yalan söyledin

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
İlk görüşte aşktı bu,senin seçilmiş gibi olduğunu hissettim
Ama damarlarındaki kan,evet, biliyorum ki donmuş(çok soğuk)
Sabrım kalmadı artık(hayır)
Çok uzun zamandır bekliyorum(evet)
Yediğin bokları sakladın ve ben bunu bilen son kişiydim sürtük(Ayy)
İçeri girdiğini duydum ve orada uyanık biçimde uzanıyordum
Gelenin sen olduğunu bilmiyordum, silahımı güvenliğim için doğrulttum
Beni tutuklattığın zamanı hatırlıyorum(Vay)
En azından hapisteyken,biraz dinlenebildim(Evet)

[Verse 2: Future]
Önemliydi, en iyi gecelerimden birinde başıma geldi
Sabahın 9'u, kulüpten çıktığımda, gündüz vaktiydi(gündüz vakti)
Kötü bir kızı sevdim, ona çok iyi davranıyordum(çok iyi davranıyordum)
Seni çok savunmasız yakaladım,bu ihtiyacım olan şey değildi(değildi)
Şimdi ruhunu sattın kızım, ağlamayı kes(ruhunu sattın)

Geçmişin seni yıkıp geçmiş,bunu reddetmeye kalkma(bildiğimi biliyorsun)
Eski sevgilin aradığında,savunmasızdın, uçuyordun,hayır
En iyi halimde değildim,kızım,deniyordum
Sana ulaşmak için her şeyi yaptım
Beni herhangi dramatik bir işe karıştırmadığını söyledin
Talihin adaleti ile karşılaştım

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Sakinleş, her şeyi ayrıntısıyla açıkladım, bu kadar basit
Kendime geldim,fark ettim, iç güdülerime güvenmeliydim
Artık oyun oynamıyorum, telefonunu kontrol etmeye gittim
Ve senin kızlarla DM'leşmeni yakaladım ve onları eve almanı
Ve biliyorum ki benden haber almayalı uzun zaman olmuştu
Çılgına döndüm ve şarkının bu kısmını bana bu yüzden verdiler
Şovlara çıkıyor çünkü onlar şovlarda beliriyor
Ayrılık notlarımın kopyası 15 milyon sattı
Yatağımıza tanımadığımız insanları getirdin
Ve şimdi özel hayata saygı hakkını kaybettin
Tüm sırlarını ortaya döküyorum
Muhtemelen bu sırların benimle birlikte mezara gideceğini düşündüğünde
Biliyorum saklı tutmayı seviyorsun
Ve çılgın olduğumu söylemene gerek yok
Çünkü biliyorum ki değişen bir şey de yok

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Çünkü beni baskı altındayken görmediler
Onlar asla görmediler, hayır, asla
Her zaman devam ettim çünkü ben çok zekiyim
Asla, asla ruhumu satamazdım, hayır, asla
Çünkü yoldaydım, yoldaydım
Tüm bu zaman boyunca benimleymiş gibi davranmayı bırak
Çünkü yoldaydım, yoldaydım
Tüm bu zaman boyunca benimleymiş gibi davranmayı bırak

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Evet, düşeceğime bahse bile girerler
Ve ben sadece 24 yaşındayım, ama, kaltak, her şeyi yaşadım
Çok fazla hit parçam var, hepsini hatırlayamıyorum (Ooh)
Ben bunları almaya devam ederken, duvarımdaki plaklarıma bakın
Hepiniz arkanıza yaslanın, geri çekilin
Nasıl davranıyorsan öyle devam et
Hayatta sahte olan kimseye saygım yok, ayy, ayy
Sen gerçekten olduğunu söylediğin kişi değilsin
Öyleyse biraz temponu arttır, beni yavaşlatmana gerek yok
Siktir git gözümün önünden, tepemin tasını attırmayı bırakabilir misin?
Çünkü zamanım pahalı, yapmam gereken bir tur listem var
Kahvaltı için seni uyandırmadan önce yeni bir araba aldım, evet

Evet, neredeydin?
Biraz iş yapma ve yerleştirme zamanı geldiğinde
Onları bakıp sadece gülüyorum, onlara bak
Kaybettiğimde kayboluyor ve kazanır kazanmaz geri dönüyorsun
Sen benim için ilk değilsin ve biliyorum arkadaşım değilsin
Sahte bir halt yediğinde seni yargılayamıyorum ve sadece rol yapıyorsun
Sanki gerçekten benimle birlikteymişsin gibi, çünkü sadık olmak insanın içinde başlar
Bu sevginin aşırı güçlendiğini ve zayıfladığını gördüm
Ama bu beni durdurmuyor, sadece devam ettim, ağzına aldı
Keşke her ezileceğimi söylediklerinde, para yapmaya devam etseydim
Etrafımda dolan ve Jeff Bezos kadar zengin ol, tekrar söyle
Asla kaybetme, spor salonunda fazla mesaiye gidiyorum
Hadi yapalım şunu

Yorgun olmaktan yoruldum
Bu benim son vuruşum, delirmemelisin, en azından denedim
Büyümemiz gerekiyordu, ama yine de çocukça davranıyorsun
Jeti tek başına alabilirim, fazladan bagaja ihtiyacım yok
Bu yıl çok vahşice geçti, Kolyemde baget var
Hızlı sürüyorum, çarpmayacağım ve ayık olmalıyım
Ama bir şekilde, sadece yüklenmeye devam ediyorum
Beni ezmek biraz daha fazla baskı gerektirecek
Elimden geldiğince denedim, ama bu noktadan sonra elimde değil
Hiç kimse ya da hiçbir şey için kaçmıyorum
Benim bir köpek olduğumu söylüyor, ama beni tanıması gerekiyor
Kendi başıma zorlanıyorum, aşka ihtiyacım yok

Evet, her hatam için dua ettin

Kurt ve ben aynı hissediyoruz
Çok fazla haz acı verir
Kız arkadaşım beni boşa harcıyor, tek yaptığım şikayet etmek
Değişmesi gereken bir şeye ihtiyacı var, kenara çekmek gerek
Bu gece hepsini boşver
Çenemi kapamamı söyleme bana
Çok fazla konuştuğunun farkındayken
Ama boş konuşuyorsun

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Aklımdan çıkmanı istiyorum
Bu gece yatak odamdan çıkmanı istiyorum
Seni kurtarmamın bir yolu yok
Çünkü benim de kurtarılmam lazım
Vedalarda iyi değilimdir
İkimiz de deli gibi davranıyoruz
Ama değişmek için fazla inatçıyız
Şimdi yine içiyorum
80 promil var kanımda
Ve Parmak uçlarım lekeli, kenara bakıyorum
Bu gece benimle uğraşma
Bu kalbe ihtiyacın olduğunu söyledin ve elde de ettin
Belli ki istediğin bu değilmiş
Ve vazgeçemedik, sonra da kaybettik
Şimdi gidiciyim

In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday

And they know where I stay
Got ""Malone"" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

Party gon' end with a threesome (Threesome)
Raw dog, prolly have three sons
Chasin' the Perc' with some Buddy, that shit never lets me down (Uhm)
They go to work for some money, we make it from actin' out (Uhm)
Grrrrrah, we takin' shots right now (Shots right now)
Grrrrrah, yeah, we takin' shots right now (Shots)

[Verse 2]
Frontin' on me, but you love it (Love it)
Tryna act like you above it ('Bove it)
Dad bod, know you wanna rub it (Rub it)
Have you ever done it in public?
Sippin' all night, let it rotate
Baby, just for the night, you my soulmate
Mixin' vodka with the champagne
Tell me how much liquor can a man take
How many records have I sold?
I don't even know, can't keep count (Nope)
You know that I've been on a roll
Celebratin' life when I come around (Come around)
Sippin' all night, sippin' all day
Brought the beerbong out like a tailgate
Holdin' big words that I can't say
Got me speakin' drunkanese, can you translate?
[Pre-Chorus]
Drunk when I walked in the door, so fuckin' high like, ""Hello""
I told her pour me some more, then she went right for the blow (The blow)
Thirty more girls wanna roll, let's get this bitch on the road (On the road)
Already losin' control, this is the life that we chose

[Chorus]
Drinkin' all night, but we ain't done yet (Yet)
Waitin' on the plug, but he ain't come yet (Yet)
Still need somethin'? Put your bank on it (Bank on it)
Got a big bag with a Bape on it (Bape on)

Sippin' Bud Light, that's the new Goose
Baby, bust it open like woo-hoo
The diamonds got cut like a boo-boo
Pockets so fat, rock a muumuu
Me and Dre came for the pum pum
Drippin', drippin', drippin', women tryna take my millions
Help my bro with an assist, I'm Jason Williams (White Chocolate)

Hahahahaha
(Tank God)
Ayy, ayy

[Nakarat: Post Malone]
Sürtükleri becerip hap alıyorum
Adamım, kendimi rock yıldızı gibi hissediyorum
Kardeşlerimin otu sağlam
Ve Rasta gibi tüttürüyorlar
Benimle uğraş, Uzi'ni kap gel
Ortaya çık ve vurucularımla karşılaş
Dostlarım mahallene uğradığında o silahın gra-ta-ta-ta gibi patlayacağından emin olacaklar

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Tarzımı değiştirdim, siyahlar içerisinde geldim
""Huzur içinde yat Bon Scott"" demeye başladım
Kapıyı kapat, tüttürüyoruz
Benden çakmak istedi beni Morrisson sanıyor (Ayy)
Sahnede aptal gibi davran
Büyük ihtimalle şovumdan polis arabası ile ayrılacaksın
Efsaneviydi, Montage'ın tepesinden televizyonu aşağı fırlattı
Masanın üstünde Kokain var, likör karışıyor hiçbir şey umrumuzda değil
Dostum, kız arkadaşın bir sürtük içeri girmeye uğraşıyor
""Ben gruptanım"" diyor (Ayy, ayy)
Kafayı yemiş gibi davranmaya başladı pantolonlarımdan tutmaya çalışıyor
Karavanımda yüz tane orospu var ve hiçbirinin bir erkeği yok
Hepsi bir arkadaşını getirmiş

Rock yıldızı gibi yaşa, polis arabasını parçala

Ahahah, yeah

[Verse 1]
When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah

You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget

He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

I done drank codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 is like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
And where I'm goin' next, man, only time will tell

I done spent some time chasin' women that don't give a shit
I done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget
Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened, now I'm makin' them hits, so I'm fuckin' your bitch (Ooh)
No, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist (Skrrt)
Spill lean on Supreme last Saturday
Let that shit splash, motherfucker, talk saucy
Pass me them drugs, motherfucker, let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothes
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly, but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grilly
I do this for realy and for my family
Same shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y
The bitches, they killin' me

Ballin', that shit Jason Kidd to me

Yeah, you want my chain and my chi

Think about you all the time
Oh my god, oh my god
And I don't care 'bout no money
There's a knot up in my throat
And I didn't come here on my own

Yeah, my wrist so cold and my ice on froze
And it's all for you
Yeah, my ice so cold and my wrist so froze
Yeah, it's all for you

My jewelry on like an ice cube
And all I wanna do is just ignite you
This Saint Laurent, mama, you look nice too
Can't hold my tongue, don't got the heart to
Remember when I fell in love?
I just came up, oh lord
Remember aim three? My fault
Told that bad bitch get on my VLONE
Hey, don't have much to do and
Everything is ruined
Ayy, ain't no secret to it
Thrown a check like a Nike, I just do it

Oh my god, oh my god
A lot of bullshit on my mind
Oh my god, oh my god

Askin' me, ""How does it feel when you know you could buy out the store?,"" ayy
I'm Bathin' Ape down to the floor, ayy
I'm droppin' the four in the foreign, ayy
I came a long way on my own, ayy

Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
She said, ""Love me"" so I love her (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
She said, ""Leave me"" so I left (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Then I went to California (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I ain't never comin' back
I got a high five from a brother (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I got bloodstains on the bed (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I ain't sayin' that I love her (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
You got just what I been looking for
But you can't bring yourself to say no
And I ain't never gonna let you go
I kept wishing I would die, oh
The whole plane ride home
And I wish I could
I know I should leave you alone
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
I worship since I met you (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I fell down to my knees (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And when no one would accept ya (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Throw myself up on a cross and bleed
I seen a dark cloud coming over (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I seen some evil shit in her head (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But she rode me like no other (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)

Good job, First
Woah, skrrt, skrrt

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone & 2 Chainz]
Diamonds in my chain gold (Okay)
Every twenty minutes, change clothes (Change up)
I had a mil' before the label (That money)
Just as long as they know, money made me do it (They know)
I said rest in peace to Bankroll (Free, God bless you)
You in a better place, dawg (God bless you)
You won't ever see me lay low (They know it)
Start the engine, watch me take off, money made me do it (Skrrt, skrrt)

I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Take a ride when we wake up
Hit the gas, melt your face off (Your face)
Spend the day countin' cake up
With a dime, who think I changed up? (I changed up)
I took the Lincoln down Rodeo (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ran through it like some Drano (Ooh, ooh)
Lot of bags, can't complain, though (No, no)
We was shoppin' in 'til they closed
Why did I do that? Did I do that? Ooh, yeah (Uh)
New whip, now, I can't pay my rent, ooh, no, oh, ooh, yeah

Clown like your daddy met your mom at a circus

Smokin' on that Meagan Good, with my niggas when I do it
Got that leather and that wood, I got the marble on the floor
Got the burglar bars on the door at the bando

And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on

I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more
