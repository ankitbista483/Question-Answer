# Genius Lyrics Search with FAISS and LLM

This project allows you to search for the most similar songs based on song lyrics using **Generative AI**, **Large Language Models (LLM)**, and **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**. The system encodes song lyrics using the **Sentence-Transformer** model and stores them in a **FAISS index** for fast retrieval of the most relevant songs based on user input.

## Features

- **Lyrics Search**: Users can input a snippet of song lyrics, and the system returns the most similar songs based on embeddings generated by a pre-trained LLM.
- **FAISS Index**: Efficiently retrieves the top N most similar songs using the FAISS index, ensuring fast search even with a large dataset.
- **Generative AI**: Uses embeddings generated by **Sentence-Transformers** (a generative AI model) to encode song lyrics, allowing semantic search rather than simple keyword matching.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.6+** installed.
2. Required Python libraries:
    - **pandas**
    - **sentence-transformers**
    - **faiss-cpu**
    - **numpy**
    - **flask**
    - **pickle**

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas sentence-transformers faiss-cpu numpy flask pickle
```

## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genius-lyrics-search.git
cd genius-lyrics-search
```

## Generate Embeddings & Create FAISS Index

```
python generate_embeddings.py
```

## Run the Flask Web Application
```
python app.py
```
## Usage
Open the web app at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Enter a snippet of lyrics from a song into the input field.
Press Search to find the most similar songs based on the lyrics.
The results will show the song titles and similarity scores, with the most similar songs listed first.
